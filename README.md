What is your question you want answered or how you want end users (i.e. the public) to use your site or visualizations. 
What are the salary estimates for data related jobs? Filtering byâ€¦
Location
Company name (public or private shown with name)
Company size
Business sector
Using relative cost of living, what locations give the highest differential between salary and cost of living (if time permits!!!)?

Data sources:
https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj.git
https://advisorsmith.com/data/coli/ (if time permits!!!)

Initial thoughts on databases you might use (PgAmin/MongoDB):
PgAdmin/SQL because our dataset fits well in a table

Initial ideas for pages or visuals (this can change):
Maps plotting markers (based on the city location) that display company name/size/industry/salary 
Dropdown by any of these metrics (location, company name, size, industry, salary, type of ownership) 
Also filter options for fine tuning 
Heatmap layer by salary estimates 
Interactable graphs
-- Average salary per state versus estimated data job salary -- 
Raw data interactable: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/table
