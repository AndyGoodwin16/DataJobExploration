What is your question you want answered or how you want end users (i.e. the public) to use your site or visualizations. 
What are the salary estimates for data related jobs? Filtering byâ€¦
Location,
Company name (public or private shown with name),
Company size,
Business sector,
Using relative cost of living, what locations give the highest differential between salary and cost of living (if time permits!!!)?

Data sources:
https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj.git,
https://advisorsmith.com/data/coli/ (if time permits!!!)

Initial thoughts on databases you might use (PgAmin/MongoDB):
PgAdmin/SQL because our dataset fits well in a table

Initial ideas for pages or visuals (this can change):
-Bar Chart
    -Uses 3 buttons to change the data set sorted by state
-Scatter Plot
    -Cost of living index versus median salary for data scientist by state
    -utilizes tooltips to show more information when mousing over data point
-Data Table
    -sorts data by the column
    -has all 707 lines of the data
    -search function throughout the entire dataset
